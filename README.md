# Snake Game AI with Reinforcement Learning 🐍🤖

This project demonstrates how an AI can learn to play the Snake game using **Reinforcement Learning**.  
The game environment is built with **Python** and **Pygame**, and the AI logic is structured in a modular way for future improvements.

## 🔥 Features
- Classic Snake game implemented with `pygame`
- AI agent that learns through reinforcement learning principles
- Clean and modular code (`game.py`, `agent.py`, `helper.py`, `model.py`)
- Easy to extend (e.g., adding Deep Q-Learning, training visualization)

## 🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KirilShy/ai-snake-rl.git
cd ai-snake-rl
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Run the game
To run the AI Snake game:
```bash
python agent.py
```

## 📌 Project Structure
```
ai_snake/
│-- agent.py     # AI agent logic and training loop
│-- game.py      # Snake game environment
│-- helper.py    # Utility functions and constants
│-- model.py     # Neural network model (if used)
│-- arial.ttf    # Font used for rendering
```

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] Implement Deep Q-Learning
- [ ] Add training progress visualization
- [ ] Create leaderboard for AI performance
